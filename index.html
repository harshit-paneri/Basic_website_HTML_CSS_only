        <p class="sectiontag text-big"OCEAN LIFE FUNDAMENTALS</p>
        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small">When speaking about our global environment, a common adage to hear is that “we know more about outer space than we do about the ocean.” In some ways, this statement is true! The oceans are vast, and exploring them is dangerous and difficult — in some ways, it’s even more difficult than exploring space. Still, our lack of knowledge about certain aspects of our oceans doesn’t mean we haven’t made an impact on them. This exclusive Faunalytics Fundamental examines our relationships with ocean life, exploring some of the most important issues facing fishes, aquatic mammals, and other species, based on the best available and current data. We hope you find the information useful in your advocacy, and in your day-to-day lives advocacy.

        <p class="sectionsubtag text-small"> While most people don’t have a direct connection to ocean life, that doesn’t stop people from having opinions about it! Whether it’s trophy fishing, marine conservation, pescetarianism, or any other issue, all of us land-dwelling humans have a lot of ideas about the oceans, marine life, and what our responsibilities to these amazing creatures are. Below, we explore some of the key attitudes people have about the state of our oceans, and their protection. </p>
